## Technologies
* React/Redux for frontend
* Rails for backend

## Why React and Rails
As mentioned in task I can use React / Redux + any server language or Ruby + Erb / Slim or mix of both. So here I choose mix of both. I am expertized in React and Rails both so it was nice opportunity for me to showcase my fullstatck development skills. Therefore I choose React + Rails.

It will be helpful for me to targeting both frontend and backend jobs.
